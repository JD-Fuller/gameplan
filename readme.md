### Phase 1

We will initialize this project by working on the backend first. We will build out the Login/Registration portions before moving to events and then to the bulletin board.

### Phase 2

See Trello Board for Phase 2

## Requirements

### Functionality



### Bonus Ideas:
- Web API integration where events have weather based on location and date, injected into their view.
