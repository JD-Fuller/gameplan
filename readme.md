# GamePlan

Gameplan is a collaboration app for groups and sports teams that serves as a solution to mutliple issues associated with conventional apps. The Gameplan serves as a single source for instant communication and document uploads for temporary groups (i.e. Seasonal Sports Teams, Weekend Excursions, Traveling school teams, etc).

## Goals

Coaches, players, & fans have a one stop shop for communication.


### Phase 1

We will initialize this project by working on the backend first Node.js

We will then build out the Login/Registration portions before moving to events and then to the bulletin board.

### Phase 2

We will build out the front end with simple pages and verification of data.

Pages to build out:

Login/Registration

Boards - Contains short list of events and Bulletin Board

Events

Notes

Teams/Roster

### Bonus Ideas:
- Web API integration where team events have weather injected into the view, based on location and date.
